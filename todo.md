# TODO list
Just came back from hiatus, making a TODO list to get back into the project.

## Setup the work environment
Mostly done already.

## Review the code
To help refresh my memory.
Also update the code if it needs more clarity.

## Check steps.md
Need to see what was being worked on and what was planned.

## Finish back-end
Finish the project within the original scope.

## Add Space Age fixes
Space Age added new features that have to be taken into consideration for machines.

Recipe productivity (steel, processing unit, etc.)
Machine productivity (independant of modules or recipe)
Updated beacons (disregard?)
Quality (disregard?)

## Front-end
TBD
